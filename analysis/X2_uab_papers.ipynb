      "right-wing and populist support for climate mitigation policies: evidence from poland and its carbon-intensive silesia region\n",
      "Research on environmental behaviour is often overlooked in literature on regime destabilization in energy transitions. This study addresses that gap by focusing on socio-political and demographic factors shaping support for carbon regime destabilization policies in one of the most carbon-intensive regions of Europe. Carbon-intensive industries, especially coal mining and coal-based power generation, are often concentrated in a few carbon-intensive regions. Therefore, decarbonization actions will affect those regions particularly strongly. Correspondingly, carbon-intensive regions often exert significant political influence on the two climate mitigation policies at the national level. Focusing on Poland, we investigate socio-political and demographic factors that correlate with the approval or rejection of the two climate mitigation policies: increasing taxes on fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal and using public money to subsidize renewable energy such as wind and solar power in Poland and its carbon-intensive Silesia region. Using logistic regression with individual-level data derived from the 2016 European Social Survey (ESS) and the 2014 Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), we find party-political ideology to be an important predictor at the national level but much less so at the regional level. Specifically, voting for right-wing party is not a divisive factor for individual support of the two climate mitigation policies either nationally or regionally. More interestingly, populism is a strong factor in support of increasing taxes on fossil fuel in the carbon-intensive Silesia region but is less important concerning in support of using public money to subsidize renewable energy in Poland overall. These results show the heterogeneity of right-wing party and populism within the support for the two climate mitigation policies. Socio-demographic factors, especially age, gender, education level, employment status, and employment sector, have even more complex and heterogeneous components in support of the two climate mitigation policies at the national and regional levels. Identifying the complex socio-political and demographic factors of climate mitigation policies across different national versus carbon-intensive regional contexts is an essential step for generating in situ decarbonization strategies. ¬© 2022 Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n",

      "global carbon inequality over 1990‚Äì2019\n",
      "All humans contribute to climate change but not equally. Here I estimate the global inequality of individual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between 1990 and 2019 using a newly assembled dataset of income and wealth inequality, environmental input-output tables and a framework differentiating emissions from consumption and investments. In my benchmark estimates, I find that the bottom 50% of the world population emitted 12% of global emissions in 2019, whereas the top 10% emitted 48% of the total. Since 1990, the bottom 50% of the world population has been responsible for only 16% of all emissions growth, whereas the top 1% has been responsible for 23% of the total. While per-capita emissions of the global top 1% increased since 1990, emissions from low- and middle-income groups within rich countries declined. Contrary to the situation in 1990, 63% of the global inequality in individual emissions is now due to a gap between low and high emitters within countries rather than between countries. Finally, the bulk of total emissions from the global top 1% of the world population comes from their investments rather than from their consumption. These findings have implications for contemporary debates on fair climate policies and stress the need for governments to develop better data on individual emissions to monitor progress towards sustainable lifestyles. ¬© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.\n",

      "board gender diversity and voluntary carbon emission disclosure\n",
      "In this study, we investigate the effect of board gender diversity on the decision to disclose carbon emissions voluntarily. Using an international sample consisting of 22,841 firm-year observations from 38 countries for the period 2010‚Äì2019, we determine the existence of a positive relationship between the percentage of female directors on the board and carbon disclosure. This evidence supports agency and resource dependency theories, as a gender diverse board indicates strong governance and better communication among stakeholders. Additionally, we examine the moderating effect of gender quotas across sample countries, where either soft or hard quotas have been implemented. We show that the number of firms disclosing their carbon emissions is, on average, higher in countries with either hard or soft quotas than in countries with no quota. Moreover, the positive effect of board gender diversity on voluntary carbon emission disclosure is similar across firms in countries with quotas and without quotas. The reported results demonstrate that there seems to be no need for country-level strict regulations regarding the firm-level percentage of female representation on the board to be effective, as gender board diversity in countries with no quotas has a similar effect in explaining voluntary carbon disclosure as in countries with quotas and those changing to quota regulation. ¬© 2022 by the authors.\n",

      "impacts of small-scale irrigation on rural households‚Äô income in north eastern ethiopia\n",
      "Irrigation is one means by which agricultural production can be increased to meet the growing food demand in Ethiopia. Small-scale irrigation is becoming the main mechanism in livelihood enhancement discourse especially in recent times when the rainfall pattern is becoming erratic in the country. Small-scale irrigation is a policy priority in Ethiopia for rural poverty alleviation and growth, as well as climate adaptation. The aim of the study is to examine the effect of small-scale irrigation on income of rural household in the North Eastern Ethiopia. The study used Taro proportional sampling techniques formula to get 200 sampling respondents of irrigation and non-irrigation users. Econometric model such as Propensity Score Matching method and binary logistic regression model were used to study the specific objectives, impact of use of small-scale irrigation on households‚Äô income and determinants of smallholder farmers‚Äô decision to participate in small-scale irrigation water use, respectively. The Propensity Score Matching model using logit estimate indicated that family size, credit access and subsidy with productive safety net program were found positive significant effect. The logit model discovered that sex, livestock holding size, dwelling distance from irrigation farm, and subsidy by productive safety net programme and credit access have determinant effect on decision participation in small-scale irrigation. Therefore, attention should be given by the government in expanding of modern irrigation practice and constructing improved storage house should be given priorities. ¬© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\n",

      "friends with benefits: how income and peer diffusion combine to create an inequality ‚Äútrap‚Äù in the uptake of low-carbon technologies\n",
      "What drives inequalities in the uptake of low-carbon energy technologies? Research has shown that people on higher incomes are significantly more likely to access and benefit from policies designed to boost uptake of clean energy technologies than those with lower incomes, revealing a pervasive inequality issue. Yet little is known about how these inequalities evolve or interact with factors beyond income alone, understanding of which is crucial to designing policies which do not simply replicate or exacerbate existing inequalities going forward. This paper thus advances the novel ‚Äúfeed-in-tariff trap‚Äù theory, which posits that, rather than income alone, peer diffusion and socioeconomic factors compound to widen inequalities in the uptake of low-carbon technologies over time. Using a combination of mixed effects and piecewise structural equation modelling, this theory is tested on the adoption of 21,206 household-level wind and solar PV installations across 6976 micro-level data-zones in Scotland between 2009 and 2020 under the UK government feed-in-tariff. It finds crucially that: (1) household solar PV and wind are adopted consistently in higher-income areas, (2) peer diffusion is strongest in higher income areas with high early adoption rates, and (3) socioeconomic conditions are extremely temporally stubborn. Combined, this trifecta creates an inequality ‚Äútrap‚Äù, locking the benefits of low-carbon technology subsidies into the same higher income areas and widening the gap in uptake between more affluent and deprived communities as a result. Recommendations are given on how best to address this, with implications for anyone concerned with a ‚Äújust‚Äù transition going forward. ¬© 2022\n",

      "unpacking the heterogeneity of climate city networks\n",
      "In recent decades, climate city networks, understood as formalized subnational governance networks that have climate change as their focus, have emerged, linking cities to the global climate governance regime and helping them to take climate action locally. Such city networks are considered an essential aspect of urban climate policy and governance. Scholarship on climate city networks has illustrated that such networks can no longer be understood as homogenous groups of organizations; rather, they show heterogeneity in how they seek to attract and engage with member cities. In this article, we unpack this heterogeneity and interrogate the various ways in which climate city networks attract and engage with their members. We are particularly interested in understanding what typifies climate city networks with an active member base. In studying 22 real-world climate city networks, we uncover five distinct types of networks with an active member base. The typology illustrates the rich, but bounded, variety of climate city networks, and helps to clarify how climate city networks can be effective in encouraging their member cities to take local climate action. ¬© 2021 The Authors\n",

      "optimizing urban electric vehicle incentive policy mixes in china: perspective of residential preference heterogeneity\n",
      "The large-scale diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) helps pave the way towards carbon peak and neutrality goals, while it is affected by the governmental incentive policies at different levels. This paper studies the optimization of demand-side policy mixes from the perspective of residential preference heterogeneity with 18 EV pilot cities in China as the case. A latent class model is used to investigate urban residents‚Äô preferences for demand-side policies and characterization of urban heterogeneities of the preferences. Valid survey data from 1455 respondents were collected from a stated preference experiment, which segmented urban residents into a ‚Äúpolicy-sensitive‚Äù group (8.25% of the sample), ‚Äúpolicy-indifferent‚Äù group (27.97%), and ‚Äúpolicy-cognitive‚Äù group according to their preferences. The 18 pilot cities were grouped into three clusters according to the different compositions of the preference segments. Our analysis shows that it may not be necessary for the municipal governments to provide subsidies for the installations of home chargers currently. Besides, different optimized policy mixes of bus lane access privileges, replacement subsidies, toll discounts, and preferential parking fees for charging were proposed for the three clusters of cities. Our research paradigm applies to cities in other countries that need to optimize EV policy mixes. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Ltd\n",

      "the exploration of joint carbon mitigation actions between demand- and supply-side for specific household consumption behaviors ‚Äî a case study in china\n",
      "The design of ‚Äúfairness‚Äù and ‚Äújustice‚Äù climate policies for controlling indirect household carbon emissions (IHCEs) requires joint efforts from the demand side and supply side. On the demand side, this study constructs behavior-specific IHCEs inventory for different household groups (differed by income level) in different regions to identify high-emitting households and corresponding high-emitting consumption behaviors. On the supply side, the ‚ÄúCarbon Account‚Äù is set up for different regions regarding various household consumption behaviors to screen all potential emitting-related stakeholders in the entire demand‚Äìsupply chains. Using 25 Chinese provinces as study cases, the findings indicate that carbon inequalities across household groups are greater than income inequalities in poorer provinces, whereas the opposite is true in richer provinces. For most high emitting households (most were middle-high- and high-income households) in 25 provinces, Food & Beverage, Housing, and Durable goods are the top 3 carbon-intensive consumption behaviors, together accounting for 64‚Äì81% (72% on average) of total IHCEs. For the three carbon-intensive behaviors, the province-level carbon account analysis shows that a province's self-production emissions (local consumption, local emissions) took up an average of 52%, 70%, and 47% of its carbon accounts. An average of 83%, 80%, and 79% of net carbon transfer-in of a province (non-local consumption, local emissions) sourced from its 5 major consuming provinces, while 76%, 81%, and 77% of transfer-out (local consumption, non-local emissions) of a province were outsourced to its 5 major producing provinces, respectively. Furthermore, according to the sector-level carbon accounts, an average of 75%, 89%, and 76% of the sector carbon transfer-in, and an average of 72%, 80%, and 79% of the sector carbon transfer-out of a province were emitted by three dominant local or non-local industrial sectors, respectively. This study could provide policy implications for local governments to take joint climate mitigation strategies between the demand-side and supply-side targeting high-emitting household consumption behaviors. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Ltd\n",

      "are gender and cultural diversities on board related to corporate co2 emissions?\n",
      "This paper aims to explore whether the female share on the boards of directors of companies influences CO2 emissions in both developed and emerging markets. Furthermore, the influence of cultural diversity on the board of directors on CO2 emissions is analysed. A sample of companies belonging to the MSCI and MSCI Emerging Market indices in Europe over ten years (2010‚Äì2019) was analysed using regression models with panel data. The results demonstrate that in both developed and developing markets, the ratio of women to men on the board of directors is inversely related to the company's CO2 emissions, which support legitimacy theory in two aspects: it fulfils the right to equality and non-discrimination for women, and it also reduces CO2 emissions. In general, cultural diversity had a negative influence on CO2 emissions. This research is relevant for policymakers and managers seeking to improve sustainability and equality policies in companies. If gender equality in corporate monitoring roles is environmentally beneficial for the planet, legislators will support quota policies. In addition, shareholders will have an incentive to implement gender equality policies, as they will legitimise the company in the eyes of society, which has economic benefits. On a practical level, this work will contribute to achieving gender equality in corporate governance and improve the understanding of factors influencing CO2 emissions to the environment. This study contributes to previous research since it is the first time that developed and emerging countries have been analysed with the same methodology in relation to gender and CO2 emissions. Moreover, this research differentiates between emission-sensitive and insensitive sectors, and it is the only study to carry out a sector-by-sector and a country-by-country analysis. Furthermore, cultural diversity on corporate boards has been scarcely studied so far in relation to CO2 emissions. ¬© 2022 The Authors\n",

      "current surveys may underestimate climate change skepticism evidence from list experiments in germany and the usa\n",
      "Strong public support is a prerequisite for ambitious and thus costly climate change mitigation policy, and strong public concern over climate change is a prerequisite for policy support. Why, then, do most public opinion surveys indicate rather high levels of concern and rather strong policy support, while de facto mitigation efforts in most countries remain far from ambitious? One possibility is that survey measures for public concern fail to fully reveal the true attitudes of citizens due to social desirability bias. In this paper, we implemented list-experiments in representative surveys in Germany and the United States (N = 3620 and 3640 respectively) to assess such potential bias. We find evidence that people systematically misreport, that is, understate their disbelief in human caused climate change. This misreporting is particularly strong amongst politically relevant subgroups. Individuals in the top 20% of the income distribution in the United States and supporters of conservative parties in Germany exhibit significantly higher climate change skepticism according to the list experiment, relative to conventional measures. While this does not definitively mean that climate skepticism is a widespread phenomenon in these countries, it does suggest that future research should reconsider how climate change concern is measured, and what subgroups of the population are more susceptible to misreporting and why. Our findings imply that public support for ambitious climate policy may be weaker than existing survey research suggests.  Copyright ¬© 2021 Beiser-McGrath, Bernauer.\n",

      "fuel subsidy reform and the social contract in nigeria: a micro-economic analysis\n",
      "Fuel subsidies in Nigeria are enormous ‚Äì around USD 3.9 billion ‚Äì almost double the health budget. Such subsidies come at great cost: the opportunity costs of such spending on other development objectives are large; the distribution of resources to the state governments is reduced; the vast majority of the subsidy goes to better off Nigerians; and cheaper petrol encourages greater pollution, congestion and climate change. Despite this, most Nigerians oppose the reduction of subsidies. We draw on a new nationally representative household survey that asked Nigerian men and women about their knowledge and attitudes towards subsidies. We construct and test a set of hypotheses about the factors associated with support for subsidy reform. We find that those who pay more or who experience less availability of fuel tend to support reform more. On the other hand, people who believe the Government is corrupt or lacks the capacity to implement compensation programs appear strongly opposed to reform. Finally, being religious and the delivery of reasonable national and local services also improves the acceptance of reform. These results support the idea that building a social contract is key to reform success. ¬© 2021 The Author(s)\n",

      "Speeding up the promotion of new energy vehicles is an important measure to optimize the energy structure, promote energy conservation and emission reduction, and develop the economy sustainability. The research uses a questionnaire survey to analyze the residents‚Äô willingness to purchase new energy vehicles in Jinan City of China, and utilizes the binomial logistic regression model and Global Moran's I to explain the impact of three factors (including respondents‚Äô personal characteristics and subjective cognition, products, and social environment) on the purchase willingness of new energy vehicles. According to the survey, 75.12% of the respondents consider buying new energy vehicles in the future, but only 11.66% of the respondents know new energy vehicles well. It can be seen that the respondents in Jinan City generally have an insufficient understanding of new energy vehicles. It may lead to a decline in residents‚Äô trust in new energy vehicles, which will in turn affect their purchase willingness. Based on the survey, we find that women who live far from the city center enjoy high incomes and have a low-carbon awareness, generally exhibit a higher willingness to purchase new energy vehicles. Spatial distribution of the purchase willingness has certain aggregation characteristics, showing a positive spatial correlation pattern. Purchase willingness has a certain positive diffusion effect in space, and areas with a higher purchase willingness have a positive driving effect on their surrounding regions. Spatial distribution of the purchase willingness can be used as one of the breakthroughs in promoting new energy vehicles. In addition, safety, price, after-sales service, and infrastructure of new energy vehicles are important determinants of people's purchase willingness. Among the types of subsidies, financial subsidy is most effective on the residents‚Äô purchase willingness. Our research provides an important information for the promotion of new energy vehicles in the region. ¬© 2021 The Authors\n",

      "transmission channels between financial development and co2 emissions: a global perspective\n",
      "This paper aims to investigate the direct and indirect effects of financial development on CO2 emissions, using a global sample of 100 countries from 1990 - 2012. Our main contribution to the literature lies in the identification and explanation of possible transmission channels that allow financial development to affect environmental quality. The paper employs 2SLS and 3SLS estimators to investigate these channels. Empirical results confirm the positive direct effect of financial development on environmental degradation. Development of the financial system also gives rise to more energy demand and consequently leads to more pollutant emissions. Besides, there is evidence about a trade-off between income inequality and environmental quality. Financial development can help redistribute income more effectively. However, high living standards will put pressure on environmental conservation. The paper also considers the nonlinear effects of financial development on carbon emission rates. Only a small proportion of the population receive the benefits at the early stages of financial development. After a certain amount of time, financial development benefits a more significant part of the population and reduces income inequality. ¬© 2020 The Author(s); CO2 emissions; Financial development; Income inequality; Energy demand; Climate policy; Energy policy; Economics; Financial economics; Energy economics ¬© 2020 The Author(s)\n",

      "global redistribution of income and household energy footprints: a computational thought experiment\n",
      "Non-technical summary. Global income inequality and energy consumption inequality are related. High-income households consume more energy than low-income ones, and for different purposes. Here, we explore the global household energy consumption implications of global income redistribution. We show that global income inequality shapes not only inequalities of energy consumption but the quantity and composition of overall energy demand. Our results call for the inclusion of income distribution into energy system models, as well as into energy and climate policy. Technical summary. Despite a rapidly growing number of studies on the relationship between inequality and energy, there is little research estimating the effect of income redistribution on energy demand. We contribute to this debate by proposing a simple but granular and data-driven model of the global income distribution and of global household energy consumption. We isolate the effect of income distribution on household energy consumption and move beyond the assumption of aggregate income-energy elasticities. First, we model expenditure as a function of income. Second, we determine budget shares of expenditure for a variety of products and services by employing product-granular income elasticities of demand. Subsequently, we apply consumption-based final energy intensities to product and services to obtain energy footprint accounts. Testing variants of the global income distribution, we find that the 'energy costs' of equity are small. Equitable and inequitable distributions of income, however, entail distinct structural change in energy system terms. In an equitable world, fewer people live in energy poverty and more energy is consumed for subsistence and necessities, instead of luxury and transport. Social media summary. Equality in global income shifts household energy footprints towards subsistence, while inequality shifts them towards transport and luxury.  Copyright ¬© The Author(s), 2021.

      "Avoiding a catastrophic climate-change event is a global public good characterized by several dimensions, notably heterogeneity between the parties involved. It is often argued that such heterogeneities between countries is a major obstacle to cooperative climate policy. We use a stylized game mimicking basic features of the climate-change dilemma to experimentally study the effect of two important heterogeneities, wealth and loss when a catastrophic event occurs. We find that under loss heterogeneity the success rate in achieving sufficient mitigation to prevent a catastrophic event is higher than under symmetry. Moreover, neither endowment heterogeneity nor the combination of endowment and loss heterogeneities lead to significantly different success rates than under symmetry. These findings suggest that heterogeneities may in fact facilitate rather than hinder successful cooperation in catastrophe prevention. ¬© 2021\n",

      "farmers‚Äô perceptions of climate change and their adaptation strategies: the case of ngamiland east, botswana\n",
      "Over the years, climate change and variability have led to a substantial decline in agricultural productivity in both developing and developed countries. Small-scale farmers are particularly at risk. The responses of farmers to climate change and variability are often dependent on their perceptions of climate change. Therefore, it is important to understand the nature of adaptation strategies that are feasible and practised at farm level. Despite this need, in some developing countries such as Botswana, there is a dearth of studies that use mixed research methods to critically analyse farmers‚Äô perceptions of climate change and their adaptation strategies. This study uses empirical data collected from farming households in the Ngamiland East region of Botswana to (i) analyse the perceptions of small-scale farmers regarding climate change, (ii) analyse small-scale farmers‚Äô adaptation strategies to climate change, and (iii) determine constraints faced by farmers in adapting to climate change and variability. The results show that there is a direct relationship between the farmers‚Äô adaptation strategies and education. Unlike findings from other studies, the results of the study show that there is no significant relationship between gender and farmers‚Äô adaptation strategies. The results verify that there is high heterogeneity characterising the case studies, making adaptation studies case-specific. Farmers in the Ngamiland region are faced with several challenges in their attempt to adapt to climate change. Chief among the constraints is the lack of financial resources and lack of appropriate skills. The government should empower the farmers through provision of subsidies and skills training. ¬© 2020 Royal Society of South Africa.\n",

      "breaking into the photovoltaic energy transition for rural and remote communities: challenging the impact of awareness norms and subsidy schemes\n",
      "Abstract: The energy poverty cycle remains a twofold barrier as part of energy transitions. Nations must support the provision of affordable and reliable power and concurrently address nationally agreed carbon reduction targets. Decentralised solar photovoltaic (PV) is a viable option to achieve universal energy access in rural areas, while it concurrently decarbonises energy generation, but often remains in tension with traditional centralised generation and distribution systems. Lack of awareness of PV technologies is seen as one of the major barriers limiting the deployment of decentralised systems in rural areas. This study explores awareness of PV systems drawing from over 700 household semi-structured surveys within Uttar Pradesh, India. We found existing awareness-raising campaigns, and subsidies for promoting PV technologies in rural areas are not effective with households preferring word of mouth, experiential learning and village-level awareness programmes than conventional electronic and print media advertising, as preferred by the government and private sectors. This lack of awareness also extends to subsidies for solar PV otherwise used to support this technology deployment and transition. We suggest locally organised and locally delivered targeted campaigns covering product knowledge, functionality and information on financing provisions for procuring solar PV system including how this relates to subsidies could be more effective to promote solar PV in the rural market. As public awareness precedes solar PV adoption, these findings can be insightful for policymakers, investors and the private enterprises to improve existing informational programmes and devise effective campaigns supporting the demand and therefore development of rural solar PV market.

      "implications of climate change for semi-arid dualistic agriculture: a case study in central chile\n",
      "The nexus between climate change, agriculture, and poverty has become a major topic of concern, especially for dry regions, which represent a large share of the world‚Äôs population and ecosystems vulnerable to climate change. In spite of this, to date, few studies have examined the impacts of climate change on agriculture and the adaptation strategies of vulnerable farmers from emerging semi-arid regions with dualist agriculture, in which subsistence farms coexist with commercial farms. This study aims to assess the micro-level impact of climate change and the farm household adaptation strategies in a semi-arid region in Central Chile. To this end, we develop a modelling framework that allows for (1) the assessment of farm-household responses to both climate change effects and adaptation policy scenarios and (2) the identification of local capacities and adaptation strategies. Aggregated results indicate that climate change has a substantial economic impact on regional agricultural income, while the micro-level analysis shows that small-scale farm households are the most vulnerable group. We observe that household characteristics determine to a large extent the adaptation capacity, while an unexpected result indicates that off-farm labour emerges as a powerful option for adapting to climate change. As such, our approach is well suited for ex ante micro-level adaptation analysis and can thereby provide useful insights to guide smart climate policy-making. ¬© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\n",

      "intertemporal lifestyle changes and carbon emissions: evidence from a china household survey\n",
      "This paper examines the endogenous evolution of household consumption patterns and household carbon emissions (HCEs) by integrating the analysis methods of income distribution with climate change. Based on a large-scale household survey spanning from 2012 to 2016 in China, we estimated the direct and indirect HCEs, observed inverse U-shaped Carbon Kuznets Curves (CKC) and significant changes in HCEs over the period at the household level. Applying the Oaxaca-Blinder method, we decomposed factors causing the changes in HCEs and found that income and demographic effects contribute only 25.1% to the total increase of HCEs. The other 74.9% remain unexplained and we define them as the effect of intertemporal lifestyle changes. Further analysis from multiple perspectives illustrates that the lifestyles of households across various social strata are becoming increasingly higher carbon-intensive over time even though the income remains unchanged. The findings indicate that existing modeling and projections of carbon emissions based on income and household characteristics may underestimate the future emissions pressure from the household sector. Hence, we conclude that in order to reach more meaningful results, the increasing effect of lifestyles should be taken into account when conducting climate change studies and formulating climate policies. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.\n",

      "mapping the carbon footprint of eu regions\n",
      "While the EU Commission has encouraged Member States to combine national and international climate change mitigation measures with subnational environmental policies, there has been little harmonized effort towards the quantification of embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from household consumption across European regions. This study develops an inventory of carbon footprints associated with household consumption for 177 regions in 27 EU countries, thus, making a key contribution for the incorporation of consumption-based accounting into local decision-making. Footprint calculations are based on consumer expenditure surveys and environmental and trade detail from the EXIOBASE 2.3 multiregional input-output database describing the world economy in 2007 at the detail of 43 countries, 5 rest-of-the-world regions and 200 product sectors. Our analysis highlights the spatial heterogeneity of embodied GHG emissions within multiregional countries with subnational ranges varying widely between 0.6 and 6.5 tCO2e/cap. The significant differences in regional contribution in terms of total and per capita emissions suggest notable differences with regards to climate change responsibility. The study further provides a breakdown of regional emissions by consumption categories (e.g. housing, mobility, food). In addition, our region-level study evaluates driving forces of carbon footprints through a set of socio-economic, geographic and technical factors. Income is singled out as the most important driver for a region's carbon footprint, although its explanatory power varies significantly across consumption domains. Additional factors that stand out as important on the regional level include household size, urban-rural typology, level of education, expenditure patterns, temperature, resource availability and carbon intensity of the electricity mix. The lack of cross-national region-level studies has so far prevented analysts from drawing broader policy conclusions that hold beyond national and regional borders. ¬© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.\n",

      "While gender issues are becoming increasingly integrated in international environment and development policies, the simplistic manner in which they are treated holds scant promise for real change. In the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) program in Burkina Faso, women are targeted in projects promoting non-timber forest product commercialisation aimed to incentivise forest conservation. Such policies are often based on essentialist assumptions about what men and women do, ignoring that social relations of inequality need to be understood in context. Drawing on intersectional theory this study analyses REDD+ documents, and data about resource use in two villages in Burkina Faso, showing how the participatory approach in Burkina's REDD+ program is unlikely to encourage currently marginalised voices to be heard in existing forest management organisations. Rather, the lack of acknowledgement of intersecting relations of inequality leads to crucial aspects of NTFP resource use being overlooked, and risks leading to increased marginalisation of certain groups.\n",

      "This paper is at the conjunction of arguments for gender equity in transport services on one hand and need to move towards low carbon transport on the other in a developing country city. The case study city, Rajkot, a mid-sized Indian city with mixed land use and limited public transport at the time of this study, has short trip lengths and low trip rates. But, even in this city there is gender disparity in travel pattern. Thus, trip rates and trip lengths of women in the city in each of the income group are lower than that of their male counter parts. With the increase in income, both, the trip rates and lengths increase, but, the increase is higher for men than for women. While the large proportions of women in each income group walk, that among the lowest income group walking is the predominant mode, as they are 'no-choice' or 'forced' walkers. With the increase in household income, women tend to shift to para-transit and men to personal motorized transport. If sustainability arguments or climate policies are to target retaining the current low ecological footprint of the women as one of the strategies, it needs to cater to expansion of their mobility while improving infrastructure to support the same. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.\n",

Results show that high-income inequality directly raises CO2 emission while indirectly reducing it through its impact on economic growth. Inequality weakens the effectiveness of certain climate change mitigation policies through an interaction effect between inequality and climate change mitigation policies. Whether inequality increases CO2 emission or vice versa cannot be confirmed from the empirical outcomes of total marginal effects of inequality on CO2 emission under different climate change mitigation policies. However, the effectiveness of climate change mitigation policies may be diminished when high inequality exists in a country. ¬© 2018, Korean Economic Association. All rights reserved.\n",

      "household and community responses to impacts of climate change in the rural hills of nepal\n",
      "The research was designed to answer how households and local communities in rural Nepal are responding to the impacts of climate change. Using four villages as case study units, a mixed method approach was adopted in a multi-scaled process carried out at community, district and national levels. The research found that adaptation practices being adopted differ according to household well-being and are largely governed by access to education, information and resources within the community. Responses such as livelihood and income diversification, internal migration, share cropping, taking consumption loans, use of alternative energy and use of bio-pesticides were found to mostly vary according to well-being status of the interviewees. Development of adaptation plans, strategies and support mechanisms should take account of the different adaptation practices and needs of households. If such individual situations are not considered, adaptation responses may be ineffective or even be maladaptive and increase vulnerability. The research also found that the autonomous, unplanned and reactive nature of adaptation practices chosen by rural communities can contribute to further inequity and unequal power relations. The knowledge generated from this research contributes to understanding of how climate change contributes to vulnerability, but also how local practices and lack of an effective climate policy or response measures may magnify the effects of many existing drivers of vulnerability in terms of maladaptation and increasing social inequalities. ¬© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.\n",

      "towards climate justice: how do the most vulnerable weigh environment-economy trade-offs?\n",
      "The world's poor are especially vulnerable to environmental disasters, including the adverse consequences of climate change. This creates a challenge for climate justice advocates who seek to ensure that those least responsible for causing climate change do not bear unwanted burdens of mitigation. One way to promote climate justice could be to pay particular attention to the environmental policy preferences of citizens from poorer, lower-emitting countries. This paper examines opinions on environment-economy trade-offs and willingness to make personal financial contributions to protect the environment among residents of 42 developed and developing countries using data from the 2005-2008 World Values Survey, the 2010 Climate Risk Index, and World Bank development indicators. Results reveal that individuals in developing countries are less likely to support policies to prioritize environmental protection over economic growth but are more willing to donate personal income for pro-environmental efforts compared to citizens of more developed nations. ¬© 2014.\n",

      "climate policies under wealth inequality\n",
      "Taming the planet's climate requires cooperation. Previous failures to reach consensus in climate summits have been attributed, among other factors, to conflicting policies between rich and poor countries, which disagree on the implementation of mitigation measures. Here we implement wealth inequality in a threshold public goods dilemma of cooperation in which players also face the risk of potential future losses. We consider a population exhibiting an asymmetric distribution of rich and poor players that reflects the present-day status of nations and study the behavioral interplay between rich and poor in time, regarding their willingness to cooperate. Individuals are also allowed to exhibit a variable degree of homophily, which acts to limit those that constitute one's sphere of influence. Under the premises of our model, and in the absence of homophily, comparison between scenarios with wealth inequality and without wealth inequality shows that the former leads to more global cooperation than the latter. Furthermore, we find that the rich generally contribute more than the poor and will often compensate for the lower contribution of the latter. Contributions from the poor, which are crucial to overcome the climate change dilemma, are shown to be very sensitive to homophily, which, if prevalent, can lead to a collapse of their overall contribution. In such cases, however, we also find that obstinate cooperative behavior by a few poor may largely compensate for homophilic behavior.\n",

      "equity and climate change: local adaptation issues and responses in the city of lake macquarie, australia\n",
      "Equity in adaptation to climate change is one of the central issues in scholarly and policy debates about improving climate policy and practice. Although equity issues have now captured the attention of diversity of actors and sectors at the international level, they have received little attention in climate change adaptation which is most visible at the local community level. This paper provides a case study of the City of Lake Macquarie in Australia to investigate how different communities perceive climate change, how they are coping with the effects of climate change and how they are likely to respond to changes in the future. The paper demonstrates the predominance of individual actions over collective action, and the low-level of influence that poorer and disadvantaged groups have over climate change policies, even when they are most impacted. The paper concludes that the known institutional barriers to climate change adaptation should be extended to include equity concerns. This extension recognizes the importance of equity in hampering physical aspects of climate change adaptation as, perversely, low income people are likely to be disadvantaged by the loss of property value. Rather than simply adding another barrier, we suggest that in these situations, equity considerations should focus on procedural equity to become part of the solution. Residents in vulnerable localities saw procedural equity, particularly in the transparency of decision-making, involvement in decision-making processes and the provision of clear and accurate information by local governments on climate change, as being the most important steps to enhance equity in climate change adaptation practice. ¬© 2014 Elsevier B.V.\n",

      "a study of residential energy use in hong kong by decomposition analysis, 1990-2007\n",
      "Energy end-use for all sectors (commercial, residential, transport, industrial) in Hong Kong shows that the residential share increased from 14.2% in 1990 to 18.1% in 2007, such share increase has prompted the authors to analyze the issue. The Divisia decomposition analysis is used to evaluate the respective contributions of changes in (1) the number of households, (2) share of different types of residential households, (3) efficiency gains, and (4) climate condition to the energy use increase. The analysis reveals that the major contributor was the increase of the number of households, and the second major contributor was the intensity effect. As expected, the segment of the private housing (apartments) was becoming less energy efficient. In addition, it is interesting to note that the energy end-use per household in the segment of government rental subsidized housing (apartments) was decreasing. The decrease of the household income in this segment may be one of the reasons while statistics showing that the number of low-income household was increasing and leaning towards the lowest income classes. On the other hand, it is believed that people tend to consume more energy to obtain a quality life characterized with comfortable living with the growth of economy and improvement of living standard. However, Hong Kong becomes a counterexample since 2004. Therefore, changing the residents' behavior may not be an effective tactic for reducing energy consumption. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.\n",

      "determinants of variation in household co2 emissions between and within countries\n",
      "Variation in household CO2 emissions between and within countries may have important consequences for the equity dimension of climate policies. In this study we aim to identify some determinants of national household CO2 emissions and their distribution across income groups. For that purpose, we quantify the CO2 emissions of households in the Netherlands, UK, Sweden and Norway around the year 2000 by combining a hybrid approach of process analysis and input-output analysis with data on household expenditures. Our results show that average households in the Netherlands and the UK give rise to higher amounts of CO2 emissions than households in Sweden and Norway. Moreover, CO2 emission intensities of household consumption decrease with increasing income in the Netherlands and the UK, whereas they increase in Sweden and Norway. A comparison of the national results at the product level points out that country characteristics, like energy supply, population density and the availability of district heating, influence variation in household CO2 emissions between and within countries. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

      "dense downtown living more carbon intense due to higher consumption: a case study of helsinki\n",
      "Hindering urban sprawl is one of the main goals for contemporary urban planning. Urban density is considered crucial in climate change mitigation since it reduces automobile dependence and decreases unit sizes, for example. This letter analyzes the effect of density in a city context. In the study the Finnish capital Helsinki is divided into two areas of different urban densities: the high density downtown area and the more scarcely populated suburbs. The study is a continuation of a recently published study on the implications of urban structure on carbon emissions, and analyzes further the main finding of the first study - that higher urban density might have negligible or even reverse effect on the per capita carbon emissions. Similarly to the previous study, a consumption based tiered hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is employed in order to produce a comprehensive assessment, free of territorial boundaries and system cutoffs typical of traditional LCAs. Based on the findings of the previous study, it is hypothesized that when assessing city level carbon dioxide emissions from a wider, consumer oriented LCA perspective, increased urban density may not necessarily reduce carbon emissions. Surprisingly, the study finds that carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions are substantially higher in the dense downtown area than in the surrounding suburbs, which is suggested to imply that the increased consumption due to the higher standard of living increases emissions more than the higher density is able to reduce them. The results demonstrate that, while increasing urban density can be justified from a number of ecological, social and economic viewpoints, density is not necessarily a key parameter in the particular case of climate change. In cities like Helsinki, where wealth is concentrated in the downtown area, climate policies should give higher priority to the energy consumption of buildings, to alternative energy production and distribution modes, as well as to low carbon consumption within the city. ¬© 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.\n",
